            <h2>Initial Planning</h2><a name="initial_planning"></a>
            <p>
                <li>Core idea</li>
                <li>Target audience</li>
                <li>Budget and scope</li>
                <li>Platforms</li>
            </p>
            <h3>CONTENTS:</h3>
            <p>Before starting to code or illustrate anything involving the game, first create an outline of the basic content. What type of game are we producing? Who are the characters? What is the basic storyline? Follow the outlines of core idea, target audience, budget/scope, and platforms.</p>
            <h2>Pre-Production</h2><a name="pre-production"></a>
            <p>
                <li>Early prototyping</li>
                <li>Storyboards</li>
                <li>Timeline and milestones</li>
                <li>Monetization model</li>
            </p>
            <h3>CONTENTS:</h3>
            <p>Now is the time to create early prototyping, storyboards, levels, models of the game. How long is the game going to be? What are the early milestones in the game? In this section of the game building process, work on the story and how the player progresses through the game. Create a basic barebones of the game. Create the dialogue of the game here in this step too.</p>
            <h2>Production</h2><a name="production"></a>
            <p>
                <li>Game Mechanics</li>
                <li>Modeling and design</li>
                <li>Development and rendering</li>
                <li>Audio and visual assets</li>
            </p>
            <h3>CONTENTS:</h3>
            <p>This is the point where the basic barebones prototype of the game turns into the game. Work on game mechanics, modeling, and design. Develop a full complete version of the game. Create a sound track and visual assets of the game. Have voice lines created and put into something that is supposed to be the final product. Finish the whole game at this point.</p>
            <h2>Testing</h2><a name="testing"></a>
            <p>
                <li>Bug fixing</li>
                <li>Gameplay testing</li>
            </p>
            <h3>CONTENTS:</h3>
            <p>This portion is where we test for any and all bugs we can think of that can occur in the game. Think and play through the game trying to break the basic game. When a bug is found fix it and immediately test if the fix created more bugs. Work on the game until every possible bug that can be found is fixed.</p>
            <h2>Launch</h2><a name="launch"></a>
            <p>
                <li>Marketing activities</li>
                <li>Polishing</li>
                <li>Master release</li>
            </p>
            <h3>CONTENTS:</h3>
            <p>Work on the marketing of this game and connect to the targetted audience. Most game companies will put out teasers and final deadlines for when the game will be published before the game is finished. I am not a game company so I will not produce teasers for the game until it is fully finished and I can work on polishing the finished game.</p>
            <h2>Post-Production</h2><a name="post-production"></a>
            <p>
                <li>Bug fixing</li>
                <li>Patching</li>
                <li>New content development</li>
            </p>
            <h3>CONTENTS:</h3>
            <p>This last section is fixing bugs that come up in after production and producing update patches to the game and how to distribute them. If this game is an evolving game from the base idea, create new storyboards and steps for new content. Push patches and updates of new content.</p>
